TEMPLATE METHOD
Provides a skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. TM lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing
the algorithm structure.

Defines the steps of an algorithm and allows subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps;

Steps:
1. Create an abstract class with a final method that will call other methods. These other methods can be abstract or implemented.
2. For abstract ones the Concrete implementation for the class will implement them.
3. We can have hook methods in the abstract method. They are methods that can or can not be overridden in the subclasses. They have some default behaviour or some conditionals.
