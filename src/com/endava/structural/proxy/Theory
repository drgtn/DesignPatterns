Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
They control and manage access to the real objects.
The client calls some methods thinking that it does on the remote object(real service),
but it does on the proxy object, and then the proxy makes call on the remote object.


Participants:
Proxy (CommandExecutorProxy) - maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the real subject.
                          Proxy may refer to a Subject if the RealSubject and Subject interfaces
                          are the same.
                          -provides an interface identical to Subject's so that a proxy can
                          by substituted for the real subject.
                          -controls access to the real subject and may be responsible for
                           creating and deleting it.
Subject (CommandExecutor)
                            - defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy so that a
                            Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
RealSubject (CommandExecutorImpl)
                            - defines the real object that the proxy represents.


Type of Proxy:
1. remote proxy - the proxy acts as a local reprezentative for an objects that lives in a different JVM. a method call on the proxy, results in the call
    being transfered over the wire.

2. virtula proxy - controls acces to a resource that is expensive to create. the proxy usually demands the creation of the remote object untill its needed.
    After the real object its created, the proxy delegates methods call to it.
3. protection proxy - controls acces to a resouce based on access rights

Adapter changes the interface of the objects it adapts, Proxy implements the same interface
Decorator adds behavior, Proxy controls access to it
