(Wrapper)
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter
lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible
interfaces.


- Target (Duck) defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses.
-  TestClass collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.
- Adaptee (Turkey) defines an existing interface that needs adapting


Steps:

1. First you need to implement the interface of the type you are adapting to. This is the interface the clinets aspects to.
2. Next we need to get a reference to the object we are adapting (via setter or constructor);
3. Now we implement the methods by calling the metthods from the object we want to adapt.


NOTE!
When the adaptee interface has additional feature oe new behavuior then we can use the DECORATOR + ADAPTER pattern for that
